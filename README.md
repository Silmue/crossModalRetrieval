# A demo of a cross-modal retrieval system

This is a corss-modal retrieval system by using Flask, which is a microframework for Python.And I will keep updating it.

You can run this system:
 `python app.py`
and the service will run on http://0.0.0.0:3000/.

We have prepared the data in the "./data/allImage" folder. If you have any question, please contact me at llluocj@gmail.com. 

The codes refer to the following papers:
